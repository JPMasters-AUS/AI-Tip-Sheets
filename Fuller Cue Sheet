# ElevenLabs Prompting & Markup Guide (Draft)

> Focus: practical markers and patterns for controlling pauses, emphasis, and delivery
> in ElevenLabs Text‑to‑Speech (especially 11v3).

---

## 1. Models, scope and caveats

- This guide assumes:
  - ElevenLabs Text‑to‑Speech, especially the **11v3** model (or newer).[web:30][web:56][web:66]
  - Usage via the web UI *or* API/SDKs (syntax is the same in the text prompt).[web:21][web:34]
- ElevenLabs:
  - Does **not** support full SSML in the usual sense, but does support a limited set of tags (e.g. `<break>` in some contexts) and its own **audio tags** in square brackets.[web:24][web:26][web:34][web:56]
  - Heavily relies on normal punctuation and good prose for natural rhythm and emphasis.[web:18][web:64][web:66]

---

## 2. Pauses and pacing

### 2.1 Precise pauses with `<break>`

Where supported (API / scripted contexts), use the SSML‑style break tag:

```text
<break time="0.3s" />  Short pause (~0.3 seconds)
<break time="1.0s" />  Medium pause (~1 second)
<break time="3.0s" />  Long pause (max recommended)

•	Syntax: <break time="Xs" /> where X is a decimal number of seconds.[web:24][web:26][web:63][web:65]
•	Typical use:
This seemed fine. <break time="1.5s" /> Then the auditors arrived.

•	Notes:
o	Values above ~3 seconds are usually not honoured or may cause odd timing.[web:24][web:63][web:65]
o	Overusing <break> can make speech sound mechanical; mix with natural punctuation.[web:24][web:65]
2.2 Punctuation‑based pauses
These are “soft” controls that work in all interfaces.
•	Comma ,
o	Short pause, like a quick breath.[web:18][web:63]
o	Use where you would naturally pause briefly when reading aloud.
•	Full stop .
o	Stronger pause and sentence boundary.[web:18][web:63]
o	Often enough by itself for normal narration.
•	Ellipsis ...
o	Creates a noticeable pause or trailing‑off; many users report 2–4 seconds when repeated.[web:22][web:25][web:59]
o	Example:
I thought about it... and decided to walk away.

•	Dashes - or —
o	Mid‑sentence pause, softer than a full stop, stronger than a comma.[web:24][web:59][web:65]
o	Example:
This seemed fine — until the auditors arrived.

•	Slashes / (informal trick)
o	Some users report that / or / / / can act as manual pause markers without being spoken.[web:59]
Rule of thumb: punctuate as you would for a human script, then add ellipses/dashes only where you still want timing stretched.[web:18][web:63][web:64]
 
3. Audio tags (11v3 and later)
11v3 adds audio tags: square‑bracket cues that influence emotion, delivery, and non‑verbal sounds.[web:45][web:56][web:66][web:68]
3.1 Basic syntax and scope
[tag] Text affected by the tag.

[tag_one][tag_two] Stacked tags, both influencing the same text.

•	Tags are case‑insensitive, but lowercase is recommended for consistency.[web:45][web:56]
•	A tag generally affects all following text until another tag appears.[web:45][web:56][web:68]
•	Works best with:
o	Model: 11v3.[web:56][web:66][web:68]
o	Mode/settings: “Natural” or creative modes that allow expressive changes.[web:68]
3.2 Delivery style tags (volume, energy, pacing)
Common patterns (names can vary; treat these as starting points):
•	Whisper / quiet:
[whispers] We probably shouldn’t be talking about this here.
[quietly] I just wanted to say thank you.

o	Tags like [whispers], [whispering], [quietly] produce low‑volume, intimate delivery.[web:45][web:56][web:68]
•	Loud / shouting:
[shouts] Stop right there!
[loudly] I completely disagree with that conclusion.

o	Tags like [shouts], [shouting], [loudly] raise volume and intensity.[web:45][web:56][web:67][web:68]
•	Pacing and rhythm:
[rushed] We need to go, now, before they see us.
[slowly] Let’s walk through this step by step.

o	Some guides mention [rushed], [slowly], or [pauses] to influence speed and breaks.[web:36][web:67][web:68]
Tip: Test tags on a short sample and listen; not all tags have identical effects on all voices.
3.3 Emotion tags
Use emotion tags to change mood without changing words.[web:45][web:56][web:68]
Examples:
[happy] The board has accepted every recommendation.
[excited] You’re not going to believe what happened next.
[sad] We lost more than we expected this quarter.
[angry] This control failure was completely avoidable.
[nervously] I’m not sure this is going to work.

•	Other common tones seen in guides: [tired], [sarcastic], [curious], [serious], [calm].[web:36][web:45][web:68]
3.4 Non‑verbal and environmental tags
These do not change words but add sounds or context.[web:36][web:45][web:56]
Examples:
[laughs] That’s one way to look at it.
[sighs] We’ve been here before, haven’t we.
[gulp] This could get messy.
[page flipping] Let me just check the report.
[footsteps hallway] Someone’s coming. Stay quiet.

•	Typical categories in example lists:
o	Reactions: [laughs], [laughs softly], [sighs], [gasp], [gulps].[web:36][web:45][web:56][web:67]
o	Environment: [page flipping], [door opens], [security alarm], [footsteps hallway].[web:36]
o	Body states: [run softly], [limp slowly], etc., for more cinematic audio scenes.[web:36]
 
4. Emphasis techniques (no formal tag yet)
There is no dedicated emphasis tag for single words, but several patterns help.
4.1 Typographic emphasis
•	Quotation marks:
That result was "unexpected", to say the least.

o	Often increases stress on the quoted word.[web:22][web:62][web:66]
•	ALL CAPS (sparingly):
This risk is REAL, not theoretical.

o	Tends to be spoken with extra force; overuse sounds like shouting.[web:22][web:62][web:66]
•	Isolate the key phrase:
The numbers looked fine.
On paper.

o	Breaking into short sentences is one of the most reliable ways to give weight to a phrase.[web:18][web:34][web:63]
4.2 Audio‑tag‑based emphasis
You can temporarily change tone around a key word:
[serious] This is important: [calm] you are not alone in this.
[excited] This is the result we’ve been waiting for.

•	For advocacy or memoir work, mixing [calm], [serious], [whispers] can land sensitive lines more gently.[web:45][web:56][web:68]
 
5. Whispering and intimate delivery
5.1 Whisper tags
For 11v3, whisper‑style delivery is usually achieved with tags.[web:41][web:45][web:56][web:68]
Examples:
[whispers] We shouldn’t be talking about this here.
[nervously][whispers] Someone is coming down the hallway.
[quiet whisper] This is just between us.

•	Behaviour:
o	Lower volume and breathier tone.[web:41][web:44][web:56][web:68]
o	Works well for asides in memoirs, intimate narration, and dramatic reveals.
5.2 Combining whisper with pauses
She smiled at the committee. <break time="0.8s" />
[whispers] They have no idea what’s coming.

•	By separating the whisper with a pause, you create a clear contrast between public and private voices.[web:24][web:41][web:56][web:68]
 
6. Practical patterns and recipes
6.1 Business / audit narration
[calm] This report highlights three key issues: governance, culture, and controls.
[serious] Each carries a material risk if left unaddressed.

•	Use:
o	Normal punctuation for clarity.
o	[calm], [serious], [confident] for professional tone.[web:34][web:64][web:66]
6.2 Memoir and narrative
I thought he’d forgotten.
... but he hadn’t.

[whispers] He remembered everything.

•	Blend ellipses, line breaks, and [whispers] for dramatic effect.[web:25][web:41][web:56][web:68]
6.3 Social justice / advocacy
[serious] Trans and gender diverse people deserve safety, respect, and dignity.
[calm] This is not optional. It is fundamental.

•	Keep sentences short and direct; use [serious] and [calm] to avoid sounding melodramatic while still firm.[web:34][web:64][web:66]
 
7. Good practice checklist
•	Write for the ear: Read the script aloud; add commas and full stops where you naturally pause.[web:18][web:63][web:64]
•	Use <break> sparingly: Save for places where you need precise timing; keep most pacing in punctuation and sentence structure.[web:24][web:63][web:65]
•	Keep tags simple:
o	Prefer a small, consistent set of audio tags you know work with your chosen voices.[web:45][web:56][web:68]
o	Document the tags you’ve tested in this file and re‑use them.
•	Test short samples: Generate 1–2 sentences, adjust tags/punctuation, then scale to longer pieces.[web:39][web:64][web:66]
•	Version control your “house style”:
o	Store this guide and sample snippets in Git.
o	Note which tags/markers work best for:
	Audit / professional reports
	Memoir / personal narrative
	Commentary / op‑ed
	Advocacy scripts
 
8. To‑do / placeholders for future you
•	[ ] Add a table of tested audio tags and example outputs for your favourite voices.
•	[ ] Document any project‑specific conventions (e.g. how you mark whispered asides in reports vs memoirs).
•	[ ] Add notes for:
o	Speech‑to‑speech use cases.[web:53]
o	Any Git scripts you write to lint or normalise tags in .md / .txt scripts before rendering.

If you want, the next step can be a small companion file, e.g. `ELEVENLABS-SNIPPETS.md`, with 10–20 ready‑to‑paste templates tailored to your four audiences (audit report finding, board commentary, memoir aside, advocacy call‑to‑action).
