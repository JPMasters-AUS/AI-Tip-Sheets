---

## 1. Audit / assurance reports

### 1.1 Finding – calm, professional

```text
[calm] This review identified three key issues: governance, culture, and controls.
[serious] Each issue carries a material risk if left unaddressed.

1.2 Finding – highlight the risk
[serious] The current access model allows privileged changes with minimal oversight.
[calm] This significantly increases the likelihood of undetected error or fraud.

1.3 Recommendation – constructive tone
[calm] We recommend implementing a centralised access review process, conducted at least quarterly.
[confident] This will reduce the risk of unauthorised activity and strengthen overall governance.

1.4 Emphasising “on paper” vs reality
On paper, the control design is sound.
[pause] <break time="0.8s" />
[serious] In practice, it is not operating as intended.

1.5 Board paper summary
[calm] In summary, the residual risk remains within appetite.
[serious] However, this position depends on timely completion of the agreed actions.

 
2. Board / business commentary
2.1 Op‑ed style opening
[calm] We like to believe our organisations are rational.
[serious] In reality, decisions are often driven by fear, habit, and convenience.

2.2 Calling out a systemic issue
[serious] This is not a story about one failure.
[calm] It is a story about a system that rewards short‑term gains and ignores long‑term risk.

2.3 Emphatic but measured
[serious] This risk is real, not theoretical.
[calm] Treating it as optional will cost more than dealing with it now.

2.4 Quiet challenge to leadership
[calm] The question is not whether we can afford to change.
[serious] The question is whether we can afford not to.

2.5 Reflective close
[calm] In the end, governance is not about paperwork.
[serious] It is about the impact our decisions have on people’s lives.

 
3. Memoir / personal narrative
3.1 Intimate aside
I thought he’d forgotten.
... but he hadn’t.

[whispers] He remembered everything.

3.2 Internal monologue
[calm] Out loud, I said everything was fine.
[whispers] In my head, I was already running.

3.3 Childhood memory
[calm] The classroom smelled like dust and photocopy toner.
[nervously] I prayed the teacher wouldn’t ask me to read aloud.

3.4 Moment of realisation
I looked at the screen.
<break time="1.2s" />
[serious] Every number told the same story.

3.5 Gentle humour
[calm] In theory, I was in control of the project.
[laughs softly] In practice, the project was very much in control of me.

 
4. Advocacy / LGBTIQA+ and trans support
4.1 Clear, steady statement
[serious] Trans and gender diverse people deserve safety, respect, and dignity.
[calm] This is not a debate. It is a basic matter of human rights.

4.2 Speaking to allies
[calm] If you are unsure what to say, start with this.
[serious] I believe you. I support you. I am listening.

4.3 Responding to harmful rhetoric
[serious] When public figures question our right to exist, it is not just a disagreement.
[calm] It is a signal that some lives are considered negotiable.

4.4 Quiet reassurance
[whispers] You are not overreacting.
[calm] What you are feeling makes sense, given what you have lived through.

4.5 Call to action
[serious] Silence protects the status quo, not the vulnerable.
[confident] Use your voice, your vote, and your influence to make space for all of us.

 
5. Mixed‑use patterns
5.1 Data point then meaning
[calm] Only thirty percent of our recommendations were implemented on time.
<break time="0.8s" />
[serious] That is not just a number. It is a measure of how safe people feel at work.

5.2 Switching tone mid‑sentence
[calm] This will not be easy.
[confident] It will be worth it.

5.3 Closing a piece
[calm] If there is one thing I have learned, it is this.
[serious] Change is messy, but staying the same costs more.

 
6. How to extend this file
•	Add real examples from your own work as you test what sounds right with your preferred voices.[web:39][web:64]
•	Keep notes on:
o	Which tags work well for each audience.
o	Any that sound off or inconsistent, so you can avoid them.[web:45][web:56][web:68]
•	Consider pairing each snippet with a short comment, e.g. who it’s for and what emotional effect you expect.

If you want, a second pass can refactor this into sections per voice or per ElevenLabs project, so it lines up directly with how you organise repos.
